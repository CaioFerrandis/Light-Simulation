This code intends to simulate what happens when a light particle hits a reflective surface (plane or not)

I intend to add the option to choose between mirrors in the future and maybe more informations about the particle.

Also, I've noticed some imprecision with the simulation, no clue what's causing that though...

In order to use the  simulation you must download the file and unzip it, then you can either choose to run the .exe or run the python file and edit the code to try and have fun with it, good luck!
